The number of column headings in the header row does not match the number of fields defined in the schema.

Things you can try:
- Check that your data does not have an extra row preceding the header row containing the column headings. 
- Check that the header row in the data is not missing a comma, or has an extra comma, between the column headings.
- Check that your schema defines the correct number of fields for your data.
