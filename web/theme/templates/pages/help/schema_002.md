This row has a different number of columns compared to the header row (the first row in your data).

A key [concept](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/json-table-schema/#concepts) is that all the rows in your tabular data must have the same number of fields (columns). 

Things you can try:
- Check your data is not missing a comma, or has an extra comma, between the fields in this row. 
- Check that your schema defines the correct number of fields for your data.
