This row has a different number of columns compared to the header row (the first row in your data).

A key [concept](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/json-table-schema/#concepts) is that all rows in your tabular data must have the same number of fields (columns). Your data may have a missing or extra delimiter between the fields in this row. The delimiter in a comma separated value (.csv) file is a comma `,`.
