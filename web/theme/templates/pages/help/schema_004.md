This field is a [required field](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/json-table-schema/#field-constraints), but it contains no value.

Things you can try:
- If you know the missing value, add it to the data.
- If the data is not required, remove the `"required": true` constraint from your schema, or change it to `"required": false`.
