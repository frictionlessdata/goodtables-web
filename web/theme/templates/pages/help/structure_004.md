The exact same data has been seen in another row.

Things you can try:
- If some of the data is incorrect, correct it.
- If the whole row is an incorrect duplicate, remove it.
- If the data is correct, choose the `Ignore duplicate rows` option in Good Tables to prevent duplicate rows being reported as an error.
